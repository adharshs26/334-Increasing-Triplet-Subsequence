The code checks if there exists a triplet (i, j, k) in the array nums such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]. 
It initializes two variables, min1 and min2, to positive infinity. 
As it iterates through the array, min1 is updated with the smallest value seen so far, and min2 tracks the second smallest value. 
If it finds a value greater than min2, it confirms that a valid increasing triplet exists and returns True. 
If no such triplet is found after scanning the entire array, it returns False.
